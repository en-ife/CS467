# CS467

CS467 Project 

This is an initial submission of my Satellite Tracking iOS app for my CS467 class. 
At present, I've built out the basic screens / UI and tap / scroll interactions. 

I pivoted to Swift only ~2 weeks ago, after I was unable to get my original plan 
(using the Kivy framework to convert Python > Xcodeproj) to work successfully.
